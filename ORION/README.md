Welcome to ORION! The Object Recognition, Image-depth, and Optical Navigation system
This is a tool to help makers measure objects on their workbench using a camera and a projector, full transpareny this was orignially made using ConceptBytes' Holomat project with some modifications from me. That being said, all credit goes to him for this project as the framework system my project uses is currently largely based on his project. I have made a few changes to his hand tracking and tools for my purpose and I intend to continue to develop it myself branching away and eventually replacing his system with my own, but in its current state it uses his code. If you are interested in learning more about his project I will have it linked here https://github.com/Concept-Bytes/Holomat Regarding the use of ORION, I would recommend this project only to someone with a significant amount of experience in python and openCV. While the project is useable as is, my lack of programming experience means that this may not work on your system. I used a Windows 10 laptop with a 720 by 480 camera and a 1280 by 745 projector.
